                    Happy Nineteen my BoooBooooo!!<br/>
                    <p>
                        Congratulations! Our relationship is legally an adult in months now. Yayyyyy!!
                        It is the last teen month for us and we are going to enjoy every bit of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, Happy Valentine's my dear Dhanss!!! I know, I know I did not do anything great
                        this time but our monthversary is far mor special for me and I know it definitely is for you.
                        So I am wishing you, my lover, my aalu, the happiest valentine's and I wish that we will be
                        together forever like this, if not closer and happier. &lt;33333
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has been an amazing month for me. Exactly one month ago, you got your first UC Berkeley
                        results, which I am so proud of you for. I got my first and amazing admission into one
                        of my ambitious schools. And we spent time together almost every day unlike before when some
                        days used to feel like we are very busy. I loved every part of it. I loved waking you up sooo
                        sooo much. Listening to your sleepy voice while you are very sleepy to even talk and talk to me 
                        with your breath &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You were just amazing. I loved the way you take time for 
                        yourself every single morning. I loved how you take time for me every single morning. i love
                        watching you have your coffee while toggling between sleeping and waking up while watching my
                        boring face. I love talking to you everyday, even if they are the samll conversations I have
                        during my tea break. The best part is talking to you makes me be honest to you as well as myself.

                        I wanna grow old with you babe. You know when I was at college, sometimes I just wanted to go home.
                        I felt like it would feel calm and stress free and loving if I stay with the people I love. When I
                        imagine living with you, I feel the same. I feel it is the most soothing and peaceful place I can
                        be. We can literally do so many things like having making coffee and having it, making food, ordering
                        in, make out, hold hands, cuddle, watch movies, wake up next to each other, take naps together,
                        love each other and the best of all, lie down without doing anything and just US. I know all this to 
                        be forever takes a long time, but knowing that the day is coming where we can do all this, it feels so
                        worthy to wait.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am doing fine baby. Sometimes I annoy you, sometimes I was unable to show how much I love you, 
                        sometimes I even forget our monthversary. But not even one second did I forget your ass. I remember
                        you when I eat, travel, sleep, pee, poo. I might get diverted when I get busy and work, but even 
                        then I would be thinking, "If only I can lie on Dhans' lap and work." 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love you. I am going to get you. I am going to live with you. I am going to watch you getting
                        everything you want (including me). You are an amazing human Dhans. You are!!! 
                        <b>
                            I think no one can be able to see how AWESOME you are. Even yourself. I am the
                            luckiest person on earth to be able to see you. Everytime you think what if Viraj finds someone
                            better, know that I found the most awesome human being ever, and I am going to have so much
                            of fun with her throughout my life.
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I want to ask you to take care of yourself. With all the work and pressure, your sleep
                        and food intake are seriosuly fucked up. I understand why nu. But I want you to start slowly and 
                        take care of those little things because you need to be healthy to win the thimgs you want.

                        <br><b id="final">YOU MAKE ME PROUD AND I WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD OF YOU NMW. YOU ARE HER!!!</b>

                        Yours, <br/>
